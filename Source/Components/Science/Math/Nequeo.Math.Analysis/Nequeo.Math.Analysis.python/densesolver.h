/*************************************************************************
Dense solver for A*x=b with N*N real matrix A and N*1 real vectorx  x  and
b. This is "slow-but-feature rich" version of the  linear  solver.  Faster
version is RMatrixSolveFast() function.

Algorithm features:
* automatic detection of degenerate cases
* condition number estimation
* iterative refinement
* O(N^3) complexity

IMPORTANT: ! this function is NOT the most efficient linear solver provided
           ! by ALGLIB. It estimates condition  number  of  linear  system
           ! and  performs  iterative   refinement,   which   results   in
           ! significant performance penalty  when  compared  with  "fast"
           ! version  which  just  performs  LU  decomposition  and  calls
           ! triangular solver.
           !
           ! This  performance  penalty  is  especially  visible  in   the
           ! multithreaded mode, because both condition number  estimation
           ! and   iterative    refinement   are   inherently   sequential
           ! calculations. It also very significant on small matrices.
           !
           ! Thus, if you need high performance and if you are pretty sure
           ! that your system is well conditioned, we  strongly  recommend
           ! you to use faster solver, RMatrixSolveFast() function.

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes two  important  improvements  of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  ! * multicore support
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Say, on SSE2-capable CPU with N=1024, HPC ALGLIB will be:
  ! * about 2-3x faster than ALGLIB for C++ without MKL
  ! * about 7-10x faster than "pure C#" edition of ALGLIB
  ! Difference in performance will be more striking  on  newer  CPU's with
  ! support for newer SIMD instructions. Generally,  MKL  accelerates  any
  ! problem whose size is at least 128, with best  efficiency achieved for
  ! N's larger than 512.
  !
  ! Commercial edition of ALGLIB also supports multithreaded  acceleration
  ! of this function. We should note that LU decomposition  is  harder  to
  ! parallelize than, say, matrix-matrix  product  -  this  algorithm  has
  ! many internal synchronization points which can not be avoided. However
  ! parallelism starts to be profitable starting  from  N=1024,  achieving
  ! near-linear speedup for N=4096 or higher.
  !
  ! In order to use multicore features you have to:
  ! * use commercial version of ALGLIB
  ! * call  this  function  with  "smp_"  prefix,  which  indicates  that
  !   multicore code will be used (for multicore support)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

Dense solver.

Similar to RMatrixLUSolve() but solves  task  with  multiple  right  parts
(where b and x are NxM matrices). This  is  "robust-but-slow"  version  of
LU-based solver which performs additional  checks  for  non-degeneracy  of
inputs (condition number estimation). If you need  best  performance,  use
"fast-without-any-checks" version, RMatrixLUSolveMFast().

Algorithm features:
* automatic detection of degenerate cases
* O(M*N^2) complexity
* condition number estimation

No iterative refinement  is provided because exact form of original matrix
is not known to subroutine. Use RMatrixSolve or RMatrixMixedSolve  if  you
need iterative refinement.

IMPORTANT: ! this function is NOT the most efficient linear solver provided
           ! by ALGLIB. It estimates condition  number  of  linear system,
           ! which  results  in  significant  performance   penalty   when
           ! compared with "fast"  version  which  just  calls  triangular
           ! solver.
           !
           ! This performance penalty is especially apparent when you  use
           ! ALGLIB parallel capabilities (condition number estimation  is
           ! inherently  sequential).  It   also   becomes significant for
           ! small-scale problems.
           !
           ! In such cases we strongly recommend you to use faster solver,
           ! RMatrixLUSolveMFast() function.

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes two  important  improvements  of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  ! * multicore support
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Say, on SSE2-capable CPU with N=1024, HPC ALGLIB will be:
  ! * about 2-3x faster than ALGLIB for C++ without MKL
  ! * about 7-10x faster than "pure C#" edition of ALGLIB
  ! Difference in performance will be more striking  on  newer  CPU's with
  ! support for newer SIMD instructions. Generally,  MKL  accelerates  any
  ! problem whose size is at least 128, with best  efficiency achieved for
  ! N's larger than 512.
  !
  ! Commercial edition of ALGLIB also supports multithreaded  acceleration
  ! of this function. Triangular solver is relatively easy to parallelize.
  ! However, parallelization will be efficient  only for  large number  of
  ! right parts M.
  !
  ! In order to use multicore features you have to:
  ! * use commercial version of ALGLIB
  ! * call  this  function  with  "smp_"  prefix,  which  indicates  that

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes two  important  improvements  of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  ! * multicore support
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Say, on SSE2-capable CPU with N=1024, HPC ALGLIB will be:
  ! * about 2-3x faster than ALGLIB for C++ without MKL
  ! * about 7-10x faster than "pure C#" edition of ALGLIB
  ! Difference in performance will be more striking  on  newer  CPU's with
  ! support for newer SIMD instructions. Generally,  MKL  accelerates  any
  ! problem whose size is at least 128, with best  efficiency achieved for
  ! N's larger than 512.
  !
  ! Commercial edition of ALGLIB also supports multithreaded  acceleration
  ! of this function. We should note that LU decomposition  is  harder  to
  ! parallelize than, say, matrix-matrix  product  -  this  algorithm  has
  ! many internal synchronization points which can not be avoided. However
  ! parallelism starts to be profitable starting  from  N=1024,  achieving
  ! near-linear speedup for N=4096 or higher.
  !
  ! In order to use multicore features you have to:
  ! * use commercial version of ALGLIB
  ! * call  this  function  with  "smp_"  prefix,  which  indicates  that
  !   multicore code will be used (for multicore support)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-

/*************************************************************************
Dense solver for A*X=B with N*N symmetric positive definite matrix A,  and
N*M vectors X and B. It is "slow-but-feature-rich" version of the solver.

Algorithm features:
* automatic detection of degenerate cases
* condition number estimation
* O(N^3+M*N^2) complexity
* matrix is represented by its upper or lower triangle

No iterative refinement is provided because such partial representation of
matrix does not allow efficient calculation of extra-precise  matrix-vector
products for large matrices. Use RMatrixSolve or RMatrixMixedSolve  if  you
need iterative refinement.

IMPORTANT: ! this function is NOT the most efficient linear solver provided
           ! by ALGLIB. It estimates condition  number  of  linear system,
           ! which  results  in  significant   performance   penalty  when
           ! compared with "fast" version  which  just  performs  Cholesky
           ! decomposition and calls triangular solver.
           !
           ! This  performance  penalty  is  especially  visible  in   the
           ! multithreaded mode, because both condition number  estimation
           ! and   iterative    refinement   are   inherently   sequential
           ! calculations.
           !
           ! Thus, if you need high performance and if you are pretty sure
           ! that your system is well conditioned, we  strongly  recommend
           ! you to use faster solver, SPDMatrixSolveMFast() function.

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes two  important  improvements  of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  ! * multicore support
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Say, on SSE2-capable CPU with N=1024, HPC ALGLIB will be:
  ! * about 2-3x faster than ALGLIB for C++ without MKL
  ! * about 7-10x faster than "pure C#" edition of ALGLIB
  ! Difference in performance will be more striking  on  newer  CPU's with
  ! support for newer SIMD instructions. Generally,  MKL  accelerates  any
  ! problem whose size is at least 128, with best  efficiency achieved for
  ! N's larger than 512.
  !
  ! Commercial edition of ALGLIB also supports multithreaded  acceleration
  ! of this function. We should note that Cholesky decomposition is harder
  ! to parallelize than, say, matrix-matrix product - this  algorithm  has
  ! several synchronization points which  can  not  be  avoided.  However,
  ! parallelism starts to be profitable starting from N=500.
  !
  ! In order to use multicore features you have to:
  ! * use commercial version of ALGLIB
  ! * call  this  function  with  "smp_"  prefix,  which  indicates  that
  !   multicore code will be used (for multicore support)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

No iterative refinement is provided because such partial representation of
matrix does not allow efficient calculation of extra-precise  matrix-vector
products for large matrices. Use RMatrixSolve or RMatrixMixedSolve  if  you
need iterative refinement.

IMPORTANT: ! this function is NOT the most efficient linear solver provided
           ! by ALGLIB. It estimates condition  number  of  linear system,
           ! which  results  in  significant  performance   penalty   when
           ! compared with "fast"  version  which  just  calls  triangular
           ! solver.
           !
           ! This performance penalty is especially apparent when you  use
           ! ALGLIB parallel capabilities (condition number estimation  is
           ! inherently  sequential).  It   also   becomes significant for
           ! small-scale problems (N<100).
           !
           ! In such cases we strongly recommend you to use faster solver,
           ! HPDMatrixSolveMFast() function.

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes two  important  improvements  of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  ! * multicore support
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Say, on SSE2-capable CPU with N=1024, HPC ALGLIB will be:
  ! * about 2-3x faster than ALGLIB for C++ without MKL
  ! * about 7-10x faster than "pure C#" edition of ALGLIB
  ! Difference in performance will be more striking  on  newer  CPU's with
  ! support for newer SIMD instructions. Generally,  MKL  accelerates  any
  ! problem whose size is at least 128, with best  efficiency achieved for
  ! N's larger than 512.
  !
  ! Commercial edition of ALGLIB also supports multithreaded  acceleration
  ! of this function. We should note that Cholesky decomposition is harder
  ! to parallelize than, say, matrix-matrix product - this  algorithm  has
  ! several synchronization points which  can  not  be  avoided.  However,
  ! parallelism starts to be profitable starting from N=500.
  !
  ! In order to use multicore features you have to:
  ! * use commercial version of ALGLIB
  ! * call  this  function  with  "smp_"  prefix,  which  indicates  that
  !   multicore code will be used (for multicore support)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

/*************************************************************************
Dense solver for A*x=b with N*N Hermitian positive definite matrix A given
by its Cholesky decomposition, and N*1 complex vectors x and  b.  This  is
"slow-but-feature-rich" version of the solver  which  estimates  condition
number of the system.

Algorithm features:
* automatic detection of degenerate cases
* O(N^2) complexity
* condition number estimation
* matrix is represented by its upper or lower triangle

No iterative refinement is provided because such partial representation of
matrix does not allow efficient calculation of extra-precise  matrix-vector
products for large matrices. Use RMatrixSolve or RMatrixMixedSolve  if  you
need iterative refinement.

IMPORTANT: ! this function is NOT the most efficient linear solver provided
           ! by ALGLIB. It estimates condition  number  of  linear system,
           ! which results in 10-15x  performance  penalty  when  compared
           ! with "fast" version which just calls triangular solver.
           !
           ! This performance penalty is insignificant  when compared with
           ! cost of large LU decomposition.  However,  if you  call  this
           ! function many times for the same  left  side,  this  overhead
           ! BECOMES significant. It  also  becomes significant for small-
           ! scale problems (N<50).
           !
           ! In such cases we strongly recommend you to use faster solver,
           ! HPDMatrixCholeskySolveFast() function.

Dense solver.

This subroutine finds solution of the linear system A*X=B with non-square,
possibly degenerate A.  System  is  solved in the least squares sense, and
general least squares solution  X = X0 + CX*y  which  minimizes |A*X-B| is
returned. If A is non-degenerate, solution in the usual sense is returned.

Algorithm features:
* automatic detection (and correct handling!) of degenerate cases
* iterative refinement
* O(N^3) complexity

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes one  important  improvement   of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Generally, commercial ALGLIB is several times faster than  open-source
  ! generic C edition, and many times faster than open-source C# edition.
  !
  ! Multithreaded acceleration is only partially supported (some parts are
  ! optimized, but most - are not).
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    A       -   array[0..NRows-1,0..NCols-1], system matrix
    NRows   -   vertical size of A
    NCols   -   horizontal size of A
    B       -   array[0..NCols-1], right part
    Threshold-  a number in [0,1]. Singular values  beyond  Threshold  are
                considered  zero.  Set  it to 0.0, if you don't understand
                what it means, so the solver will choose good value on its
                own.
                
OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    Info    -   return code:
                * -4    SVD subroutine failed
                * -1    if NRows<=0 or NCols<=0 or Threshold<0 was passed
                *  1    if task is solved
    Rep     -   solver report, see below for more info
    X       -   array[0..N-1,0..M-1], it contains:
                * solution of A*X=B (even for singular A)
                * zeros, if SVD subroutine failed

SOLVER REPORT

Subroutine sets following fields of the Rep structure:
* R2        reciprocal of condition number: 1/cond(A), 2-norm.
* N         = NCols
* K         dim(Null(A))
* CX        array[0..N-1,0..K-1], kernel of A.
            Columns of CX store such vectors that A*CX[i]=0.
