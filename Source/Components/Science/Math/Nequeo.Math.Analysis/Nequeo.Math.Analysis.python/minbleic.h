                     BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
       WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

DESCRIPTION:
The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
combination of:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints

REQUIREMENTS:
* user must provide function value and gradient
* starting point X0 must be feasible or
  not too far away from the feasible set
* grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
  L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
* function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

USAGE:

Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
   MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBLEICSetCond().

4. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

5. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

6. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
   with same N but another starting point.
   MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

/*************************************************************************
The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
   gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
   problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

This function sets boundary constraints for BLEIC optimizer.

Boundary constraints are inactive by default (after initial creation).
They are preserved after algorithm restart with MinBLEICRestartFrom().

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    BndL    -   lower bounds, array[N].
                If some (all) variables are unbounded, you may specify

NOTE 1: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:
* there always exists some minor violation (about Epsilon in magnitude)
  due to rounding errors
* numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
  outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
  numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.
If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
(this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
solution and in all intermediate points).

/*************************************************************************
This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
functions.

There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients

    X       -   array[0..N-1], solution
    Rep     -   optimization report. You should check Rep.TerminationType
                in  order  to  distinguish  successful  termination  from
                unsuccessful one:
                * -8    internal integrity control  detected  infinite or
                        NAN   values   in   function/gradient.   Abnormal
                        termination signalled.
                * -7   gradient verification failed.
                       See MinBLEICSetGradientCheck() for more information.
                * -3   inconsistent constraints. Feasible point is
                       either nonexistent or too hard to find. Try to
                       restart optimizer with better initial approximation
                *  1   relative function improvement is no more than EpsF.
                *  2   scaled step is no more than EpsX.
                *  4   scaled gradient norm is no more than EpsG.
                *  5   MaxIts steps was taken
                *  8   terminated by user who called minbleicrequesttermination().
                       X contains point which was "current accepted"  when
                       termination request was submitted.
                More information about fields of this  structure  can  be
                found in the comments on MinBLEICReport datatype.

BLEIC results

Buffered implementation of MinBLEICResults() which uses pre-allocated buffer
to store X[]. If buffer size is  too  small,  it  resizes  buffer.  It  is
intended to be used in the inner cycles of performance critical algorithms
where array reallocation penalty is too large to be ignored.

/*************************************************************************
This subroutine restarts algorithm from new point.
All optimization parameters (including constraints) are left unchanged.

This  function  allows  to  solve multiple  optimization  problems  (which
must have  same number of dimensions) without object reallocation penalty.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure previously allocated with MinBLEICCreate call.
    X       -   new starting point.

/*************************************************************************
This subroutine submits request for termination of running  optimizer.  It
should be called from user-supplied callback when user decides that it  is
time to "smoothly" terminate optimization process.  As  result,  optimizer
stops at point which was "current accepted" when termination  request  was
submitted and returns error code 8 (successful termination).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   optimizer structure

NOTE: after  request  for  termination  optimizer  may   perform   several
      additional calls to user-supplied callbacks. It does  NOT  guarantee
      to stop immediately - it just guarantees that these additional calls
      will be discarded later.

NOTE: calling this function on optimizer which is NOT running will have no
      effect.
      
NOTE: multiple calls to this function are possible. First call is counted,
      subsequent calls are silently ignored.

/*************************************************************************
This  subroutine  turns  on  verification  of  the  user-supplied analytic
gradient:
* user calls this subroutine before optimization begins
* MinBLEICOptimize() is called
* prior to  actual  optimization, for each component  of  parameters being
  optimized X[i] algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * if needed, steps are bounded with respect to constraints on X[]
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point
  * in case difference between prediction and actual value is higher  than
    some predetermined threshold, algorithm stops with completion code -7;
    Rep.VarIdx is set to index of the parameter with incorrect derivative.
* after verification is over, algorithm proceeds to the actual optimization.

NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) gradient evaluations. It
        is very costly and you should use  it  only  for  low  dimensional
        problems,  when  you  want  to  be  sure  that  you've   correctly
        calculated  analytic  derivatives.  You  should  not use it in the
        production code (unless you want to check derivatives provided  by
        some third party).

NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
        (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
        lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
        parameters by means of setting scale with MinBLEICSetScale().

NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
        I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
        step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
        sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding
        function.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep>0 activates verification
