/*************************************************************************
        NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

DESCRIPTION:
The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


REQUIREMENTS:
Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
* function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
   other functions
3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
   with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

/*************************************************************************
The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
information about creation of CG optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
   Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
   nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

/*************************************************************************
This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) "how large" the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients

This function allows to suggest initial step length to the CG algorithm.

Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It
can be useful when you have  badly  scaled  problem,  i.e.  when  ||grad||
(which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
magnitude different from the desired step.

Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,
then  it  will  decrease step length by 2 (up to 20 attempts) and will get
10^44, which is still too large.

This function allows us to tell than line search should  be  started  from
some moderate step length, like 1.0, so algorithm will be able  to  detect
desired step length in a several searches.

Default behavior (when no step is suggested) is to use preconditioner,  if
it is available, to generate initial estimate of step length.

This function influences only first iteration of algorithm. It  should  be
called between MinCGCreate/MinCGRestartFrom() call and MinCGOptimize call.
Suggested step is ignored if you have preconditioner.

   Be careful to choose variant of MinCGOptimize()  which  corresponds  to

/*************************************************************************
This function sets low-rank preconditioner for Hessian matrix  H=D+V'*C*V,
where:
* H is a Hessian matrix, which is approximated by D/V/C
* D=D1+D2 is a diagonal matrix, which includes two positive definite terms:
  * constant term D1 (is not updated or infrequently updated)
  * variable term D2 (can be cheaply updated from iteration to iteration)
* V is a low-rank correction
* C is a diagonal factor of low-rank correction

Preconditioner P is calculated using approximate Woodburry formula:
    P  = D^(-1) - D^(-1)*V'*(C^(-1)+V*D1^(-1)*V')^(-1)*V*D^(-1)
       = D^(-1) - D^(-1)*VC'*VC*D^(-1),
where
    VC = sqrt(B)*V
    B  = (C^(-1)+V*D1^(-1)*V')^(-1)
    
Note that B is calculated using constant term (D1) only,  which  allows us
to update D2 without recalculation of B or   VC.  Such  preconditioner  is
exact when D2 is zero. When D2 is non-zero, it is only approximation,  but
very good and cheap one.

This function accepts D1, V, C.
D2 is set to zero by default.

Cost of this update is O(N*VCnt*VCnt), but D2 can be updated in just O(N)
by MinCGSetPrecVarPart.

/*************************************************************************

This  subroutine  turns  on  verification  of  the  user-supplied analytic
gradient:
* user calls this subroutine before optimization begins
* MinCGOptimize() is called
* prior to  actual  optimization, for each component  of  parameters being
  optimized X[i] algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point
  * in case difference between prediction and actual value is higher  than
    some predetermined threshold, algorithm stops with completion code -7;
    Rep.VarIdx is set to index of the parameter with incorrect derivative.
* after verification is over, algorithm proceeds to the actual optimization.

NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) gradient evaluations. It
        is very costly and you should use  it  only  for  low  dimensional
        problems,  when  you  want  to  be  sure  that  you've   correctly
        calculated  analytic  derivatives.  You  should  not use it in the
        production code (unless you want to check derivatives provided  by
        some third party).

NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
        (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
        lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
        parameters by means of setting scale with MinCGSetScale().

NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
        I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
        step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
        sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding
        function.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep>0 activates verification
