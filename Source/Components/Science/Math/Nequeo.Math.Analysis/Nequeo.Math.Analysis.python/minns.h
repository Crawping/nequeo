/*************************************************************************
                  NONSMOOTH NONCONVEX OPTIMIZATION
            SUBJECT TO BOX/LINEAR/NONLINEAR-NONSMOOTH CONSTRAINTS

DESCRIPTION:

The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
combination of:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints
* nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
* nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)<=0

IMPORTANT: see MinNSSetAlgoAGS for important  information  on  performance
           restrictions of AGS solver.

REQUIREMENTS:
* starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
  set
* F(), G(), H() are continuous, locally Lipschitz  and  continuously  (but
  not necessarily twice) differentiable in an open dense  subset  of  R^N.
  Functions F(), G() and H() may be nonsmooth and non-convex.
  Informally speaking, it means  that  functions  are  composed  of  large
  differentiable "patches" with nonsmoothness having  place  only  at  the
  boundaries between these "patches".
  Most real-life nonsmooth  functions  satisfy  these  requirements.  Say,
  anything which involves finite number of abs(), min() and max() is  very
  likely to pass the test.
  Say, it is possible to optimize anything of the following:
  * f=abs(x0)+2*abs(x1)
  * f=max(x0,x1)
  * f=sin(max(x0,x1)+abs(x2))
* for nonlinearly constrained problems: F()  must  be  bounded from  below
  without nonlinear constraints (this requirement is due to the fact that,
  contrary to box and linear constraints, nonlinear ones  require  special
  handling).
* user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()  at  all
  points where function/gradient can be calculated. If optimizer  requires
  value exactly at the boundary between "patches" (say, at x=0 for f=abs(x)),
  where gradient is not defined, user may resolve tie arbitrarily (in  our
  case - return +1 or -1 at its discretion).
* NS solver supports numerical differentiation, i.e. it may  differentiate
  your function for you,  but  it  results  in  2N  increase  of  function
  evaluations. Not recommended unless you solve really small problems. See
  minnscreatef() for more information on this functionality.

USAGE:

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNSCreate() call  and   chooses
   what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
   with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
   may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
   guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
   default settings.

   From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
   sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.

   In the current release following solvers can be used:
   * AGS solver (activated with MinNSSetAlgoAGS() function)

2. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
   of calling one of the following functions:
   a) MinNSSetBC() for boundary constraints
   b) MinNSSetLC() for linear constraints
   c) MinNSSetNLC() for nonlinear constraints
   You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.

3. User sets scale of the variables with MinNSSetScale() function. It   is
   VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
   constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

4. User sets stopping conditions with MinNSSetCond().

5. Finally, user calls MinNSOptimize()  function  which  takes   algorithm
   state and pointer (delegate, etc) to callback function which calculates
   F/G/H.

7. User calls MinNSResults() to get solution

8. Optionally user may call MinNSRestartFrom() to solve   another  problem
   with same N but another starting point. MinNSRestartFrom()  allows   to
   reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

NOTE: minnscreatef() function may be used if  you  do  not  have  analytic
      gradient.   This   function  creates  solver  which  uses  numerical
      differentiation with user-specified step.

/*************************************************************************
Version of minnscreatef() which uses numerical differentiation. I.e.,  you
do not have to calculate derivatives yourself. However, this version needs
2N times more function evaluations.

2-point differentiation formula is  used,  because  more  precise  4-point
formula is unstable when used on non-smooth functions.

    C       -   linear constraints, array[K,N+1].
                Each row of C represents one constraint, either equality
                or inequality (see below):
                * first N elements correspond to coefficients,

NOTE: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:

* there always exists some minor violation (about current sampling  radius
  in magnitude during optimization, about EpsX in the solution) due to use
  of penalty method to handle constraints.
* numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
  outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
  numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.

If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
(this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
solution and in all intermediate points).

This function sets nonlinear constraints.

In fact, this function sets NUMBER of nonlinear  constraints.  Constraints
itself (constraint functions) are passed to minnsoptimize() method.   This
method requires user-defined vector function F[]  and  its  Jacobian  J[],
where:
* first component of F[] and first row  of  Jacobian  J[]  correspond   to
  function being minimized
* next NLEC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
  equality constraints G_i(x)=0
* next NLIC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
  inequality constraints H_i(x)<=0

NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If
      your problem has mixed constraints, you  may explicitly specify some
      of them as linear ones. It may help optimizer to  handle  them  more
      efficiently.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure previously allocated with minnscreate() call.
    NLEC    -   number of Non-Linear Equality Constraints (NLEC), >=0
    NLIC    -   number of Non-Linear Inquality Constraints (NLIC), >=0

NOTE 1: nonlinear constraints are satisfied only  approximately!   It   is
        possible   that  algorithm  will  evaluate  function  outside   of
        the feasible area!

NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to   scale   specified   by
        minnssetscale()  function,  so  it can handle problems with  badly
        scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).

        However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
        constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling  of  Gi/Hi  may
        ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  "1000*G0(x)=0"
        is NOT same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".

        It  means  that  YOU  are  the  one who is responsible for correct
        scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend you
        to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component  of
        dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit  magnitude  (for  problems
        with unit scale)  or  has  magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i]
        (where S is a scale set by minnssetscale() function).

NOTE 3: nonlinear constraints are always hard to handle,  no  matter  what
        algorithm you try to use. Even basic box/linear constraints modify
        function  curvature   by  adding   valleys  and  ridges.  However,
        nonlinear constraints add valleys which are very  hard  to  follow
        due to their "curved" nature.

        It means that optimization with single nonlinear constraint may be
        significantly slower than optimization with multiple linear  ones.
        It is normal situation, and we recommend you to  carefully  choose
        Rho parameter of minnssetalgoags(), because too  large  value  may
        slow down convergence.

/*************************************************************************
This function tells MinNS unit to use  AGS  (adaptive  gradient  sampling)
algorithm for nonsmooth constrained  optimization.  This  algorithm  is  a
slight modification of one described in  "An  Adaptive  Gradient  Sampling
Algorithm for Nonsmooth Optimization" by Frank E. Curtisy and Xiaocun Quez.

This optimizer has following benefits and drawbacks:
+ robustness; it can be used with nonsmooth and nonconvex functions.
+ relatively easy tuning; most of the metaparameters are easy to select.
- it has convergence of steepest descent, slower than CG/LBFGS.
- each iteration involves evaluation of ~2N gradient values  and  solution
  of 2Nx2N quadratic programming problem, which  limits  applicability  of
  algorithm by small-scale problems (up to 50-100).

IMPORTANT: this  algorithm  has  convergence  guarantees,   i.e.  it  will
           steadily move towards some stationary point of the function.

           However, "stationary point" does not  always  mean  "solution".
           Nonsmooth problems often have "flat spots",  i.e.  areas  where
           function do not change at all. Such "flat spots" are stationary
           points by definition, and algorithm may be caught here.

           Nonsmooth CONVEX tasks are not prone to  this  problem. Say, if
           your function has form f()=MAX(f0,f1,...), and f_i are  convex,
           then f() is convex too and you have guaranteed  convergence  to
           solution.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    Radius  -   initial sampling radius, >=0.

                Internally multiplied  by  vector of  per-variable  scales
                specified by minnssetscale()).

                You should select relatively large sampling radius, roughly
                proportional to scaled length of the first  steps  of  the
                algorithm. Something close to 0.1 in magnitude  should  be
                good for most problems.

                AGS solver can automatically decrease radius, so too large
                radius is  not a problem (assuming that you  won't  choose
                so large radius that algorithm  will  sample  function  in
                too far away points, where gradient value is irrelevant).

                Too small radius won't cause algorithm to fail, but it may
                slow down algorithm (it may  have  to  perform  too  short
                steps).
    Penalty -   penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints:
                * for problem with nonlinear constraints  should  be  some
                  problem-specific  positive   value,  large  enough  that
                  penalty term changes shape of the function.
                  Starting  from  some  problem-specific   value   penalty
                  coefficient becomes  large  enough  to  exactly  enforce
                  nonlinear constraints;  larger  values  do  not  improve
                  precision.
                  Increasing it too much may slow down convergence, so you
                  should choose it carefully.
                * can be zero for problems WITHOUT  nonlinear  constraints
                  (i.e. for unconstrained ones or ones with  just  box  or
                  linear constraints)
                * if you specify zero value for problem with at least  one
                  nonlinear  constraint,  algorithm  will  terminate  with
                  error code -1.

ALGORITHM OUTLINE

The very basic outline of unconstrained AGS algorithm is given below:

0. If sampling radius is below EpsX  or  we  performed  more  then  MaxIts
   iterations - STOP.
1. sample O(N) gradient values at random locations  around  current point;
   informally speaking, this sample is an implicit piecewise  linear model
   of the function, although algorithm formulation does  not  mention that
   explicitly
2. solve quadratic programming problem in order to find descent direction
3. if QP solver tells us that we  are  near  solution,  decrease  sampling
   radius and move to (0)
4. perform backtracking line search
5. after moving to new point, goto (0)

As for the constraints:
* box constraints are handled exactly  by  modification  of  the  function
  being minimized
* linear/nonlinear constraints are handled by adding L1  penalty.  Because
  our solver can handle nonsmoothness, we can  use  L1  penalty  function,
  which is an exact one  (i.e.  exact  solution  is  returned  under  such
  penalty).
* penalty coefficient for  linear  constraints  is  chosen  automatically;
  however, penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints must be specified
  by user.

/*************************************************************************
This subroutine submits request for termination of running  optimizer.  It
should be called from user-supplied callback when user decides that it  is
time to "smoothly" terminate optimization process.  As  result,  optimizer
stops at point which was "current accepted" when termination  request  was
submitted and returns error code 8 (successful termination).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   optimizer structure

NOTE: after  request  for  termination  optimizer  may   perform   several
      additional calls to user-supplied callbacks. It does  NOT  guarantee
      to stop immediately - it just guarantees that these additional calls
      will be discarded later.

NOTE: calling this function on optimizer which is NOT running will have no
      effect.

NOTE: multiple calls to this function are possible. First call is counted,
      subsequent calls are silently ignored.

NOTES:

1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
   (analytical) user-supplied Jacobian, and one which uses  only  function
   vector and numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
   gradient.

   Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
   you should choose appropriate variant of  minnsoptimize() -  one  which
   accepts function AND Jacobian or one which accepts ONLY function.

   Be careful to choose variant of minnsoptimize()  which  corresponds  to
   your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
   callback (function/gradient) passed to minnsoptimize()    and  specific
   function used to create optimizer.


                     |         USER PASSED TO minnsoptimize()
   CREATED WITH      |  function only   |  function and gradient
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   minnscreatef()    |     works               FAILS
   minnscreate()     |     FAILS               works

   Here "FAILS" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer creation
   function  and  minnsoptimize()  version.   Attemps   to    use     such
   combination will lead to exception. Either  you  did  not pass gradient
   when it WAS needed or you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.
